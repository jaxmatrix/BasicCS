# Computer Science 

In this series you will learn about following :- 

1. Generation  of information from data 
2. Development of computational tools for product development
3. Management of computer network and distribution of load over internet

## Generation of information from data

This section consist of tools that are used for analysis and rigorous calculation.

### Python 

This will be the default language that we will be using for analysis of data

Steps : 

1. Make a github repository with name GID and fill [this](https://forms.gle/trGm18EYhWnrnGhT9) form.
2. Install Anaconda for this [link](<https://www.anaconda.com/>)
3. Introduction to jupyter notebook [Link](<https://www.datacamp.com/community/tutorials/tutorial-jupyter-notebook>)
4. Learning Python perform the tutorials given in the following tutorial series and submit the generate the output in the respective directory :: [Tutorial Series](<https://www.w3schools.com/python/>) 

### Data Representations 

In this section we will use different techniques to retrieve and write the files and learn about simulation of dynamics system using multi-threading program

1. Linking google drive and output of data in the jupyter notebook

2. Recording data from the sensor and uploading it into the google drive

3. Generation of different types of graphs using Matplotlib

   1. Generation of random data
   2. Bar Graphs
   3. Line Graphs 
   4. Scatter plots 
   5. Cluster plots

4. Using Qt to generate different types of interfaces 

5. Making Custom graphs on Qt with python 

6. Realtime Plot of data from mic

7. Analysis of Data from mic using neural network

8. Regressions 

9. Monte Carlo Simulation and analysis 

   

## Development of computational tools for product development

In this section we will cover bit of game development, modelling of systems logically and interface design on linux system

## Management of computer network and distribution of load over internet

In this section we will learn about the computer networks and distribution of job over network of computer and hardware.
